# Workshop 4: Component Libraries
This git repo is part of Social Coding's Component Library workshop. The purpose of this demo is to give students a starting place for creating their own component libraries.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## File Structure
The main home page for this app is loaded from the src/App.js file. All of my custom components are in the components folder.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Learn More
